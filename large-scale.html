	One of my interested research goal is definitely to aim the soft robots inspired by biology system dealt with 
designing/fabricating, modeling, and controlling. For example, especially, smart soft robots is challenging to 
integrate a sensor, communication, and controller together.
Fortunately, according to my PhD work, pneumatic artificial muscle(PAM) is one of the soft actuator, which is 
considered compliant actuator and modeled as non-linear actuation system.
In terms of control problem, due to high 
complicated non-linear system, the classical control + fuzzy control is employed to be control approach based 
on <b>model-free control and information based</b>.
